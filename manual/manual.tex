\section{First steps}

\subsection{Instalation}

The Pumpkin project is based on ROS (Robot Operatin System), a framework and system that creates a base layer for distributed systems.

The system is intended to be run into, at least, two different devices. One of them will hold the core system, that read from the sensors, and command the servos. The others devices will run the GUI (Graphical User Interface).

\subsubsection{Necessary components}

The ROS, by default, runs on Linux, but there is possible to install ROS in other systems, although the Pumpkin is not tested in other system.

The installation guide can be found in: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation.

The Pumpkin was developed in the ROS Indigo, since it has more support. So, it's sugested that install this version.
